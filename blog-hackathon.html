							<p>Last weekend marked my first hackathon, and I <i>almost</i> can't wait to do another.</p>
							<p>With zero hackathon experience collectively, and having never worked together before, I wasn't sure what to expect. What my team delivered in 48hrs continues to impress.</p>
							<p>Was I exhausted come Sunday? Yes. Was it worth it? YES. It pushed me out of my comfort zone. Suddenly, I was a Product Manager and Front-End hacker, because that's what our team needed.<br>Not only that, but I learned more in a weekend than I have on entire projects due to the sheer velocity, domain specific knowledge, and amazing collaboration of our team.

							<h2>Learn</h2>
							<p>We selected the Movember Foundation as our charity. There were 3 challenges provided, with opportunity to discuss with stakeholders and gather additional insights.</p>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-xlarge-12" style="border-left:10px solid #efefef;padding:30px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-bottom:20px;">
							<p><b>Movember Foundation Challenges</b></p>
							<p>1. Engagement on causes year-round<br>
								There is a lack of awareness around the full cause, with fundraisers and donations concentrated in November. "No one knows it's not just Movember, how do you add to that?"</p>
							<p>2. Awareness about impact<br>
								Fundraisers and donors don't know where the funds are going, the impact here or globally. Users want this information, and for those who don't have a personal connection to the causes, it's critical.</p>
							<p>3. New ways to engage users with data<br>
								They have a lot of data but it's not being shared with the community, so they're looking for ways to leverage it or collect more.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
						<br>
						<p>After discussing these challenges in depth, we asked what outcome they'd like to see one year from now - diversified campaigns with increase in donations in other months of the year. <br>With all this info in hand, we conducted a lean heuristics analysis on the current website and mobile app, where we validated the stakeholder concerns. As a result, we confirmed that information related to other causes and ways to raise funds were lost in Movember branding, required too many clicks to uncover, and there was no sense of impact.</p>


						<h2>Build</h2>
						<p>We wanted to tackle the core of the problem, and reach the year objective, but we wanted to do it faster. So, our MVP was built to test the assumptions in the challenges.</p>

						<div class="row">
				<div class="col-xlarge-12" style="border-left:10px solid #efefef;padding:30px;padding-bottom:10px;margin-bottom:20px;">
							<p><b>Hypotheses</b></p>
							<p>We believe that highlighting the other causes and ways to get involved will promote campaign diversity and will result in increased donations in other months of the year.</p>
							<p>We believe that providing visibility into where funds go and the impact will result in increased donations in other months of the year.</p>
							<p>Dependent variable: Donations (outside November and total)<br>Success measures: number of new fundraisers, number of second fundraisers, and number of different campaigns by one user.</p>

						<p><b>Solution</b><br>
						Fast forward through wireframing, concept testing with stakeholders, data viz-ing, prioritizing, iterating, and some delicious food... And you get our solution<br>

					<p><b>The Problems We Tackled</b></p>
						<p>1. Engagement on causes year-round</p><p>
						- General public: home page redesigned to highlight different causes and ways to get involved year-round. We kept what was working, but updated information architecture to bring key information to the forefront and improve UX.<br>
						- General public & existing fundraisers: introduced badges for the different ways to get involved, to bring equal weight to the other causes (it's not just Movember), and promote engagement and retention through gamification.
						</p>
					</p>
					<br>
						<p>2 -3. Awareness about impact & engaging users with data</p>
							<p>- General public: implemented infographics and live data visualizations to show impact and where funds are going locally and globally (most critical for engaging those that don't have a personal connection to the cause).
							<br>- Existing fundraisers: introduced data visualizations with positive feedback, personalizing the impact, to motivate and engage in new ways.
							<br>- Donors: included the option for fundraisers to share the impact data of their fundraising, providing visibility not only to fundraisers but also to donors.</p>

						<h2>Measure</h2>
						<p>Given that the end-to-end was 48hrs, there was no measure phase. However, the design intent was to test prior to implementation, validate the assumptions, and reduce implementation cost and waste (it is a charity after all).</p>
						<p>For example, through user testing (a/b), it would be possible to determine a) if we were more successful in communicating the other causes and ways to raise money, b) if we were more successful in communicating impact, and most importantly c) if user behaviour would change as a result (fundraise or donate). Going further, the modular design makes it possible to test if one data visualization proved more effective than others, and if that efficacy is significant enough to motivate those without a personal connection.</p>
						<p>In the event that this proved true, the mvp could be as lean as few content updates and one data visualization.</p>


						<h2>+Learn</h2>
							<p>What would we do next time? For anyone considering a hackathon, here's a few takeaways from our retro.
							<ul>
							<li>Have fun</li>
							<li>Know the rules of the game</li>
							<li>Anything you normally do, you will need to do faster</li>
							<li>Leverage previous work where possible</li>
							<li>Wear the right hat</li>
							</ul>
							</p>
							<p><b>A hackathon hat</b><br>
							My biggest takeaway, is that I should have left my consulting hat at home. I needed to change the way I thought, and put on a hackathon hat. I learned that the rules were different here, the solution needn't be your lean mvp. So, we likely should have spent less time in the problem space, as the goal is different - find a problem to solve (not necessarily <i>the</i> problem). Also, softer deliverables, like the ui and branding, are just nice to haves in this game - keep it focused on the tech and how to innovate it.</p>
							<p>Something else I learned, is what it's like to go through a code merge and have <i>my</i> code break.<br>So, that's a new thing I can empathize with :)</p>
